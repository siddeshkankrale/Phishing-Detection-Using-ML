🛡️ PhiShield – Phishing Detection Tool
PhiShield is a phishing detection tool that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to identify malicious emails and URLs. Designed to enhance cybersecurity, PhiShield helps detect and block phishing attempts before they cause harm.

🚀 Features
🔍 Detects phishing emails using NLP techniques

🌐 Analyzes URLs to identify malicious links

🤖 Machine Learning-based classification for high accuracy

📊 Real-time detection and reporting

🛠️ Easy to integrate into existing systems

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / (your ML framework)

NLP (spaCy / NLTK / Transformers)

Flask / Streamlit (for UI if any)

Pandas, NumPy

Regex and URL parsing libraries

🏁 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip

Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phisheild.git
cd phisheild
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the App

Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
🧪 How It Works
Email/URL Input: The user inputs an email or URL.

Preprocessing: The input is cleaned and tokenized.

Feature Extraction: NLP and URL features are extracted.

Prediction: The trained ML model classifies the input as phishing or legitimate.

Result: Output is displayed to the user with confidence scores.

📊 Model Training
You can retrain the model using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Customize the dataset or algorithm in the /data and /src folders.
